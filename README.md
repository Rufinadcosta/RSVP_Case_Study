# RSVP Movies 

##  Project Overview
This project involves using SQL to analyze historical movie performance data provided by RSVP Movies, an Indian film production company. As they plan their first global movie release, they aim to make data-driven decisions based on market trends, genre performance, revenue patterns, and regional preferences.


## Business Goal
To help RSVP Movies:
- Understand which genres, languages, or regions perform best globally
- Identify key drivers of box office revenue and audience engagement
- Strategically select genre, language, and release timing for global success

##  Tools & Technologies Used
- **SQL (PostgreSQL/MySQL)** â€“ for querying and data manipulation
- **DBMS** â€“ used for schema design and joins
- **Excel / CSV** â€“ original data format
- **VS Code / DBeaver / MySQL Workbench** â€“ IDE for SQL scripting

##  Data Description
The dataset contains information across multiple related tables:
- **Movies** â€“ details about title, genre, release year, country, and language
- **Revenue** â€“ box office performance data (domestic & international)
- **Ratings** â€“ user and critic ratings from various platforms
- **Crew/Cast** â€“ directors, producers, lead actors, etc.

The SQL script is divided into four thematic segments:

### Segment 1: Genre and Language Preferences
- Analyze the most popular and profitable genres globally
- Determine performance by language and region

### Segment 2: Revenue and Ratings Correlation
- Understand how ratings (user and critic) affect box office success
- Identify which rating platforms best predict revenue

### Segment 3: Cast & Crew Performance

- Identify patterns in production houses and budget allocation

### Segment 4: Country & Regional Insights
- Analyze international markets with highest revenue contributions
- Recommend regions for global release based on past trends
